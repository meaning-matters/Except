Example 6: Propagation and overruling. This routine spells "M a g i c" and
returns 2. The return(1) overrules the thrown Throwable and return(2) overrules
return(1); subsequently return(2) is propagated to the outermost try statement
in this routine, after which the native 'return 2' is finally executed.

{
    try {
        try {
            try
                throw (Throwable, 0);
            catch (Throwable, e)
                return(1);
            finally {
                printf("M a ");
                return(2);
            }
        }
        catch (Throwable, e)
            printf("Magic");
        finally
            printf("g ");
    }
    finally
        printf("i c");
    return(3);
