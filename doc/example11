Example 11: A VxWorks implementation of the application supplied routine for
guarding changes to package internal data. This does disable task scheduling;
so when deleting a task, there's no need to get hold of the lock. [VXW51]


#include <vxWorks.h>

void LockUnlock(int mode)
{
    if (mode == 0)
        taskUnlock();
    else
        taskLock();
}
