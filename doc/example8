Example 8: More structural checks (e.g., dealing with wrong use of a library)
are done with assert(), while behavioral checks (dealing with run-time 
conditions) are done with validate().


#include "Assert.h"

void * ListRemoveHead(List *pList)
{
    assert(pList != NULL);
    validate(pList->count > 0, NULL);
    ...
}
