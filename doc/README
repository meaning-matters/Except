Title:  Let's Finally Try to Catch C
Sub:    Centralized exception handling in C
By:     Cornelis van der Bent


This directory contains the following files:

text        - the plain ASCII (line width 80) article text including author
              biography and references. It's about 2500 (~2550 not counting
              author biography and references) words as Jon suggested.

exampleNN   - 12 code example files including headings in plain ASCII (80).

sidebar1    - Side bar of 500 words. A bit long, but yet interesting; it does
              not contain useless details.

figure1     - ASCII text figure with heading.

figureN.fm  - 4 diagrams in FrameMaker format.  Each includes a heading.

figureN.gif - Same 4 diagrams as GIF image.

listing1,2  - Two listings with a total length of 454 lines. Longer than the
              Author Guidelines suggest, I know.  I think that many readers
              will, for this article, be very interested in the code because 
              it's not features or concepts alone that are interesting. Just
              as I would, readers will want to know/see how to create something
              so similar to C++ and Java (even with inheritance) in C!

              I already stripped away the hundreds of comment lines, removed
              vertical white space and left out not essential details.
              Minimizing the length much further will do no good.
