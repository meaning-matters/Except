Example 12: A Solaris threads implementation of the routine used by the package
to guard critical changes to internal data. Because this routine does not
disable thread scheduling, code killing a thread must hold the lock. [SOL26]


#include <thread.h>

void LockUnlock(int mode)
{
    static mutex_t mutex;
    static int     initialized;

    if (!initialized) {
        mutex_init(&mutex, 0, 0);
        initialized = 1;
    }

    if (mode == 0)
        mutex_unlock(&mutex);
    else
        mutex_lock(&mutex);
}
